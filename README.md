# Machine-Learning-Fundamentals
The work focuses on **understanding and applying core machine learning concepts using Python**, mainly in the context of model evaluation and interpretation.  The objective of the project is educational, aimed at reinforcing theoretical concepts through hands-on experimentation rather than building production-ready models.
