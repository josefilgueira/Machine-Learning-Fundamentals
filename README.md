# Machine Learning – Applied Regression and Model Interpretation

This repository contains an applied Machine Learning assignment developed as part of my Master’s program.  
The work focuses on **using regression models to analyze relationships between variables and interpret results**, rather than on building optimized or production-ready models.

The objective of the project is educational, reinforcing theoretical concepts through **hands-on experimentation and interpretation of statistical outputs** using Python.

## 📁 Dataset

The analysis is based on structured datasets provided during the course.  
The data is used to explore relationships between explanatory variables and target variables in a supervised learning context.

---

## 🔍 Analysis Workflow

The notebook follows a structured analytical flow:

### 1. Data Preparation
- Loading and inspecting the dataset
- Selection of explanatory variables and target variable
- Preparing data structures for modeling

### 2. Linear Regression Modeling
- Implementation of **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** regression
- Estimation of model coefficients
- Analysis of statistical significance and goodness of fit

### 3. Model Interpretation
- Interpretation of regression coefficients
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as **R²**
- Discussion of limitations and assumptions of linear regression models

The emphasis is placed on **understanding model behavior and outputs**, not on hyperparameter tuning or advanced optimization.
