# Machine Learning Fundamentals – Applied Exercises

This repository contains practical machine learning exercises developed as part of my Master’s program.  
The work focuses on **understanding and applying core machine learning concepts using Python**, mainly in the context of model evaluation and interpretation.

The objective of the project is educational, aimed at reinforcing theoretical concepts through hands-on experimentation rather than building production-ready models.

## 📁 Dataset

The analysis is based on structured datasets provided during the course, used to validate theoretical questions and modeling assumptions.

The data is used to explore relationships between variables and to apply basic predictive techniques.

## 🔍 Analysis & Modeling

The notebook includes applied exercises covering topics such as:

- **Linear Regression**
  - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
  - Interpretation of coefficients
  - Evaluation of model fit (R², statistical significance)

- **Scoring & Predictive Modeling**
  - Feature–target relationships
  - Use of Python to validate model-based answers
  - Interpretation of predictions in an applied context

- **Statistical Validation**
  - Use of regression outputs to support analytical conclusions
  - Understanding model limitations

The emphasis is placed on **correct reasoning and interpretation**, not on hyperparameter tuning or model optimization.
